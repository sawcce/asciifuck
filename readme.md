It's like brainfuck but for ASCII documents

# How To

This is a really simple compiler:
```
+ Increments the value of the current character
> Selects the next character

Any other character is ignored
```

Clone the repository, cd into it, then run `cargo install --path .` to install the cli globally on your computer under the name of `asciifuck`. 

Then, run `asciifuck help` to get to know how to use the tool.
